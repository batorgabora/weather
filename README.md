This is a simple weather app I made using Swift in Xcode. <br>
                    It fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API based on user-inputted city names. <br>
                    The app displays the current temperature, weather conditions, and an icon representing the weather. <br>
                    The user interface is built with UIKit, featuring a clean layout with a text field for city input, a button to fetch the weather, and labels to display the results. <br>
                    Error handling is included to manage invalid city names or network issues, providing user feedback through alerts. <br>
                    Overall, this project helped me learn how to work with APIs, handle JSON data, and create a responsive UI in Swift. <br><br>
                    funcionality:
                    🌍 random weather of 20 cities <br>
                    🏙️ weather in Debrecen (my hometown) <br>
                    📍 weather in user’s location <br>
                    🔍 weather of searched city <br>
                    + includes forecasts <br><br>

//extra info:
Basically the scripts can be found in the weather directory, in seperate organized directories, only thing is that to resources a Secrets.plist shall be added based on the template of Secrets-template.plist with your own API key from OpenWeather and that should be it.
