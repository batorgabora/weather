Hey, I did this project around a year ago while still in high school, so it's kind of just about getting to know Swift and API's but turned out quite all right <br>
I used Xcode and OpenWeather's API and added extra functionality such as searching for cities and also finding the location of the user (if agreed) <br>

//functionality:
earth globe icon: random weather of 20 cities around the world <br>
city icon: weather in Debrecen <br>
location icon: weather in user's location <br>
magnifying glass icon: weather of searched city <br>
+
forecasts as well

//extra info:
Basically the scripts can be found in the weather directory, in seperate organized directories, only thing is that to resources a Secrets.plist shall be added based on the template of Secrets-template.plist with your own API key from OpenWeather and that should be it.
